Over the summer I had the opportunity to intern at [Data Minded](www.dataminded.com), a consultancy company specialized in Data Engineering. During my time there, I got to experience engineering from two different angles. First as an engineer working on product design and second as a consultant working for another company. I believe it would be interesting to dive deeper into comparison since it is a decision every engineer faces during their career.

# Product Design
## Project Description
My first three weeks were spent working on Data Minded's own product, [Conveyor](https://www.dataminded.com/conveyor). Conveyor is a solution which makes it possible for everyone to easily build, deploy and scale their data projects. One of the main goals of this product is to enable less technical profiles to deploy scaleable data pipelines.

My project was a small part of this bigger goal, I added easy-to-use alerting functionality. Before this feature, every user had to create their own functions and callbacks to be able to have alerting functionality, now it is just a setting in the web-UI.

## Beauty of Product Engineering
This is immediately where the most attractive part of product engineering lies for me, the feeling that you are a part of something bigger then yourself. The feeling of working towards a common goal step-by-step. You have this product which you can improve every day.

The building of a complex production-ready product at scale inherently brings fascinating challenges you might never encounter in another way. This is something that really amazed me when I first started, the casual way in which one of my colleagues mentioned that he was in discussion with the lead maintainer of [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) to fix an issue. It stunned me that we were testing the limits of a technology almost every company around the world relies on.
